Earlier, Kolkata Knight Riders won the toss and elected to field against the inaugural IPL champions. 

Brett Lee and Shakib Al Hasan have joined the KKR in the XI as Ryan ten Doeschate misses out, while Shane Watson returns for Rajasthan. 

On a roll with consecutive wins under its belt, a confident Rajasthan Royals would be bolstered by the return of in-form Australian all-rounder Shane Watson when they take on an unpredictable Kolkata Knight Riders. 

Under wily Shane Warne, the Royals have started their IPL 4 campaign in great style, comfortably defeating Deccan Chargers and Delhi Dare Daredevils by eight and four wickets respectively in their first two games. 

And Watson, who was in destructive form against Bangladesh in the just-concluded three-match ODI series, will further strengthen Rajasthan's batting as well as bowling departments. 

Watson scored a mammoth 294 runs against Bangladesh, which included a whirlwind 185 not out in the second ODI including a world record of 15 sixes. 

Rajasthan's batting has been the cornerstone of their victories in the opening two matches with South African Johan Botha playing the lead role with unbeaten knocks of 67 and 39.
